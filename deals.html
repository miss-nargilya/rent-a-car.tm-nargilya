           <p>Some of the words you’ll see have very specific meanings, so please check out the ‘Car rental dictionary’ in our Terms of Service.
            When you book a Rental, Booking.com Transport Limited provides and is responsible for the Platform – but not the Travel Experience itself (see 3B below). Booking.com Transport Limited is a company registered in England and Wales .</p>
   <h2 style="color: brown;">B. How does our service work?</h2>
   <p>We make it easy for you to compare Bookings from many different car rental companies. The information on our Platform is based on what Service Providers tell us. We do our best to keep things up to date at all times.
    <br>
    Our Platform tells you how many Rentals you can book through us worldwide - and our search results page tells you how many of them might be right for you, based on what you’ve told us.
